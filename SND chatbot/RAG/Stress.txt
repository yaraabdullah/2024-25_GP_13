Title: Stress
​​
stress definition:
Stress is a state of worry or mental tension triggered by challenging situations. For students, it is a natural response to academic demands like exams, deadlines, or adjusting to university life. While manageable levels of stress can motivate us to perform better, chronic or excessive stress can negatively affect mental and physical health. How we respond to stress determines how well we function in both academic and personal settings.

How stress affect us:
Stress impacts both the mind and body. A manageable amount of academic stress might improve focus and help you meet deadlines. However, when stress becomes overwhelming, it can lead to burnout, decreased academic performance, and physical symptoms like headaches or sleep disturbances. Recognizing and managing stress early can enhance your well-being and academic success.

Symptoms of stress:
Academic stress can make it difficult to relax, often leading to anxiety, irritability, and difficulty focusing on studies. This can impact exam performance, assignments, and overall productivity. Physically, stress may cause headaches, muscle tension, stomach issues, or trouble sleeping, making it even harder to stay on top of coursework.

Possible causes of stress:
Stress affects people differently. Moreover, the causes of stress vary from a person to another, and the level of stress that you feel comfortable with may be higher or lower for others around you. Tense feelings usually occur when we feel that we do not have the resources to manage the challenges we face. Stress at work, school, home, illness, or difficult or sudden life events can lead to stress. Some possible causes include:
• Individual genetics, upbringing, and experience.
• Personal life and relationship difficulties.
• Major or unexpected life changes.
• Difficult or unstable work environment.
• A feeling of loneliness and lack of support. 



How to manage and deal with stress?

If academic pressure feels too much, try adjusting your workload and prioritizing tasks. Delegating responsibilities in group projects, setting realistic expectations, and avoiding perfectionism can also reduce stress.
